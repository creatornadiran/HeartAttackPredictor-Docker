  This project presents a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack in a patient, based on their medical history and other relevant factors. The model is deployed in a Docker container and exposed through a Flask web application, allowing anyone to use it through a simple web interface. The web app provides instant predictions of heart attack risk for the input data, and it ensures confidentiality and reliability of the model and data. This project showcases the potential of combining machine learning, Docker, and Flask for building scalable and valuable health tools.
